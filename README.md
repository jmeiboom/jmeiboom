### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Justin. I live in Canada. I am glad to be here. I am a chef. I have little experience with coding. I tried a few years back to learn how to create websites. I learned alot then, but I kind of lost interest. When it came to java script I didn't take the time to figure it out. I am still interested in learning computer languages and programming. I am currently learning Python and want to design programs for the food service industry. My first and current project that I decided to work on is a menu planner and food cost calculator. I look forward to learning more about Python and other languages as I continue to work on my project. Right now I am heavily reliant on Chat GPT to help me figure out how to write this code. I am a dreamer with some good ideas and I want to learn how to realise my dreams. I hope that Github will be a good place for me to share knowledge and gain knowledge with others.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me. If you have any questions please reach out and ask. I am also happy to collaborate if you like my project or if you think I will have insight on your project.
